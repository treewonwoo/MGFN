# 🔐 MGFN Cryptanalysis Projects

This repository provides **C and Python implementations** for cryptanalysis and 128-bit master-key recovery on the MGFN block cipher:

- **MGFN-18R Linear Cryptanalysis** (fully automated, C)
- **MGFN-24R Differential Cryptanalysis** (manual step-by-step pipeline, C+Python)

Each project is self-contained with its own subdirectory and detailed README.

## 📚 Project Overview

MGFN is a 128-bit block cipher.  
This repository contains two separate attacks:

- `MGFN_Linear_Cryptanalysis/`  
  **Linear cryptanalysis** for 18 rounds (fully automatic, single command execution)  
  - End-to-end C implementation: dataset generation, 3-round key recovery, and exhaustive master-key search

- `MGFN_Differential_Cryptanalysis/`  
  **Differential cryptanalysis** for 24 rounds (manual, step-by-step scripts and C programs)  
  - Modular pipeline: Python+ C scripts for each stage  
  - User must configure and run each stage individually

All dataset sizes, file paths, and parameters must be set at the top of each script or source file before running.  
**The 18R linear attack is fully automatic; the 24R differential attack is modular and requires manual control for each step.**

## 🚦 How to Use

### 🔷 Linear Cryptanalysis (18R)
- Enter the `MGFN_Linear_Cryptanalysis/` directory.
- See its `README.md` for a **fully automated** key recovery: just run a single command for end-to-end attack.

### 🔷 Differential Cryptanalysis (24R)
- Enter the `MGFN_Differential_Cryptanalysis/` directory.
- See its `README.md` for a **manual step-by-step pipeline**: edit variables and file paths as needed, and run each stage of the pipeline in order (data generation, merging, filtering, key recovery, etc.).

---

**General Notes**
- For both variants, you must set file paths, dataset sizes, mask values, and performance parameters at the top of each script or source file before running.
- Intermediate files can be several gigabytes—ensure you have enough disk space.

> For full details, see the individual `README.md` files in each subdirectory.
